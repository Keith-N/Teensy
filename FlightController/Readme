This is the flight controller code for use with the teensy 3.5. Currently uses no EEPROM data and needs work with the autoleveling capability due to drift. 
The ESC pulses calculated from reciever inputs and gyro measurements seem to impact the proper motors.

Also, input ranges for the ESCs may need to be adjusted to make them all spin at the same throttle inputs. They can be programmed using BLHeli Suite.
